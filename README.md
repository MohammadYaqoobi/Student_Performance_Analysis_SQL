# Student Performance & Educational Data Mining 📊

## 👨‍🏫 Project Overview
**Merging Educational Management with Data Analytics.**

As an **Educational Management Graduate** skilled in Data Analysis, I developed this project to demonstrate how data-driven insights can solve real-world challenges in schools.
Unlike generic analysis, this project applies **Educational Psychology principles** to interpret data, using **SQL** to uncover the root causes of academic performance issues.

## 📂 Repository Structure & Analysis
This repository contains 4 SQL scripts, answering specific managerial questions:

### 1. Risk Behavior Analysis
*   **File:** `Query 1 Impact of High Risk Behavior (Alcohol & Health) on Final Grades`
*   **Objective:** Analyzing how alcohol consumption and health status correlate with final grades.
*   **Insight:** Identifying students who need immediate counseling due to high-risk behaviors.

### 2. Effectiveness of Support Systems
*   **File:** `Query 2 Effectiveness of Educational Support Systems`
*   **Objective:** Evaluating whether paid classes and school support are actually improving student grades (Return on Investment analysis).
*   **Insight:** Comparison of grade improvement between supported and non-supported students.

### 3. Family Dynamics (Social Psychology)
*   **File:** `Query 3 Correlation between Family Stability and Academic Performance`
*   **Objective:** Investigating the impact of parental cohabitation status (Pstatus) and family relationship quality on study time and grades.
*   **Insight:** Validating the correlation between a stable home environment and academic focus.

### 4. Predictive Assessment
*   **File:** `Query 4 Predicting Failure based on Past Failures and First Period Grade`
*   **Objective:** Creating logic to predict future failure based on 1st-period grades and past failures.
*   **Insight:** Helping school administrators identify "At-Risk" students early in the semester.

## 🛠 Unique Value Proposition
- **Domain Knowledge:** Deep understanding of *Educational Management*, *Crisis Management*, and *Psychology* allows for meaningful interpretation of data, not just number crunching.
- **Technical Skill:** Proficient in **SQL** (Aggregations, Case Statements, Filtering) to extract actionable intelligence from raw data.
